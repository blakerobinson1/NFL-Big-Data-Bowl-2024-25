However, it is difficult to execute consistenly. Therefore, teams, players, and coaches stand to benefit from an increased scrutinization of positive and negative outcomes based on the input of a press-man pre-snap alignment. While 3rd parties like PFF have made great strides in the documenting qualitative data such as defensive play types and individual coverage assignments, there is unfortunately no existing data to determine whether or not a cornerback is playing in a press alignment. Thankfully, we can determine press alignment by looking at how far off the line of scrimmage a cornerback lines up before the snap, using pre-snap tracking data. This project aims to measure cornerback performance in press-man coverage.\n\nGoal: Rank NFL cornerbacks by the following metrics, based on performance when lined up in a press-man pre snap alignment.\n - Targets allowed over expected\n - Catches allowed over expected\n - Yards allowed over expected\n - Passes defended over expected\n - Interceptions over expected","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Engineering\nImporting Dependencies","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom xgboost import XGBRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\nfrom imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport os\nimport matplotlib as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-06T07:47:44.569350Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-06T07:47:44.569805Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-06T07:47:44.578987Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-06T07:47:44.569767Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-06T07:47:44.577478Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":48},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Loading in each CSV data source into relevant dataframes\nIn a now removed one-time step, I loaded in all tracking data and filtered out all player-play records for players that aren't cornerbacks or wide receivers, and saved these datasets to new CSV files.

Additionally, due to the above filtering to only include coverage assignments of \"MAN\", I know that this dataset only includes passing play-lines for cornerbacks in man coverage.\n\nThis section starts by converting the \"time\" column to a datetime type which can be sorted and ordered. Then, while grouping by universal player ID, it finds the latest timestamp index for each play-line (i.e. the last pre-snap timestamp before the snap, based on the above filtering) and adds that to a new dataframe, called \"tracking_final_frame\", to represent these last moments before snaps. These rows can then be inferred to be the cornerback's tracking position at the time of the snap.\n\nNext, it merges this tracking data with the play data from relevant_plays, to show us the the outcome of the play for each pre-snap tracking line.\n\nLastly, it determines the cornerback's distance from the line of scrimmage by utilizing absoluteYardlineNumber, and subtracting the player's X value (equivalent to the player's own absoluteYardlineNumber) from it. If this number is less than or equal to 3 (meaning the corner is 3 yards or less from the line of scrimmage), then we know the corner was lined up in a press-man alignment for that play, and the play-row is given a 1 for this new \"in_press\" column.

Corners who are allowing more targets over expected are likely not staying in an advantageous coverage position, are covering a mismatch, or are being schemed at by the offense. By contrast, cornerbacks who are allowing fewer targets than expected are likely keeping a strong position in coverage, or are being schemed away from by the offense. Given that there are 9 weeks included in the sample, it becomes a fairly safe assumption to ascribe the ratings to coverage performance.\n\nThese findings can be used in future weeks as a starting point for deeper analysis, to spur questions like: why are higher corners allowing more targets in press coverage? Or, why are the lower cornerbacks stifling their coverage assignments? From a data standpoint, these results can be used to inform a defensive coordinator on which of their corners are allowing more targets in press than they should be, or which corners are performing better than expected. In turn, pre-snap alignments can be adjusted to line up poor performers off the line of scrimmage more often, or strong performers in press more often.\n\nThese findings can also inform offenses to gameplan their receivers who are strong against press to face corners struggling in press more often. Quarterbacks and wide receivers can be informed to look for particularly advantageous matchups when a specific cornerback is lined up in press pre-snap. \n\nA caveat of expected targets is that cornerbacks who are allowing more targets than expected could be more often charged with covering the offense's first read or #1 receiver. For example, Chidobe Awuzie, Jalen Ramsey, and Stephon Gilmore often covered the best receiver on the opposing team, and those coverage assignments will naturally draw more targets, regardless of if the corner is in press alignment. Where outsized insight comes from are those types of cornerbacks who are allowing targets under expected, such as Marlon Humphrey, Trevon Diggs, and Marshon Lattimore.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"targets = totals_expected_aggregated[['displayName', 'snaps', 'targets', 'expected_targets', 'targets_oe']].sort_values(by='targets_oe', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\ntargets.to_csv('targets.csv', index=False)\n\ntargets","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.865628Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.866032Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.899435Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.865999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.898167Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":76,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             displayName  snaps  targets  expected_targets  targets_oe\n0         Chidobe Awuzie     74       16         13.466761    2.533239\n1       Cameron Dantzler     28        7          5.141062    1.858938\n2        Charvarius Ward     65       14         12.168337    1.831663\n3      Cornell Armstrong     23       10          8.249307    1.750693\n4           Jalen Ramsey     19        6          4.268343    1.731657\n5        Patrick Surtain     59        9          7.279074    1.720926\n6      Damarion Williams     28       11          9.347524    1.652476\n7          Avonte Maddox     32        5          3.383404    1.616596\n8        Stephon Gilmore     67       20         18.418325    1.581675\n9          Donte Jackson     32       11          9.440722    1.559278\n10         Anthony Brown     38       16         14.477732    1.522268\n11          James Pierre     21        7          5.513928    1.486072\n12         Taron Johnson     44        8          6.553446    1.446554\n13         Xavien Howard     82       21         19.553711    1.446289\n14         Carlton Davis     46       18         16.581982    1.418018\n15       Amani Oruwariye     47       12         10.614645    1.385355\n16         Paulson Adebo     55       14         12.615621    1.384379\n17   Ahkello Witherspoon     31       10          8.691035    1.308965\n18        Cameron Sutton     39        9          7.839681    1.160319\n19           Jalen Mills     55       16         14.852403    1.147597\n20          Bradley Roby     45       14         12.923981    1.076019\n21        Roger McCreary     66       11          9.951805    1.048195\n22           Mike Hughes     36        7          5.955575    1.044425\n23     Christian Benford     24        4          2.988484    1.011516\n24         Ahmad Gardner     71       13         11.990207    1.009793\n25            Jamel Dean     69       11         10.031349    0.968651\n26         Isaiah Oliver     12        3          2.100114    0.899886\n27       Joshua Williams     27        9          8.119629    0.880371\n28          Levi Wallace     33       11         10.140480    0.859520\n29          Marco Wilson     39        7          6.149149    0.850851\n30        Alontae Taylor     56       15         14.212329    0.787671\n31        Martin Emerson     62       20         19.246113    0.753887\n32      Rachad Wildgoose     23        5          4.252062    0.747938\n33         Michael Davis     33        8          7.262774    0.737226\n34             Eli Apple     43        8          7.265247    0.734753\n35              Sam Webb     10        3          2.460094    0.539906\n36        Kendall Fuller     43        7          6.480343    0.519657\n37      Shaquill Griffin     30        4          3.512503    0.487497\n38      Patrick Peterson     13        3          2.532853    0.467147\n39           Coby Bryant     11        4          3.540447    0.459553\n40           Darius Slay     32        4          3.596334    0.403666\n41           Eric Stokes     53        7          6.601695    0.398305\n42       Greedy Williams     15        2          1.622946    0.377054\n43        Amik Robertson     44        6          5.631184    0.368816\n44            Dee Alford     32        5          4.643509    0.356491\n45          Jerry Jacobs     12        3          2.685196    0.314804\n46        C.J.

However, expected catches in particular inform how well a corner is doing at the catch point. Without necessarily making a play on the ball, this metric can inform how well a cornerback is disturbing a wide receiver's process after being targeted. This (naturally) does take into account whether or not the receiver was targeted, which as described above, speaks to the corner's positioning. \n\nThere are notable crossovers at the top and bottom of the list compared to expected targets, including Chidobe Awuzie, who appears to be performing poorly in press-man, and DJ Reed, who appears to be a strong performer in press-man coverage. Interestingly, one corner who allowed more targets than expected but allowed far fewer catches than expected was Xavien Howard. Reviewing film might inform why this is. Perhaps he isn't as effective at pre-throw positioning, and much more effective at affecting receivers while the ball is in the air.

Higher yards over expected can indicate a tackling or angles weakness, or it can indicate a corner's tendency to play the ball instead of the receiver, manifesting more clearly when the ball is caught. \n\nYardage allowed appears to have a strong crossover with receptions allowed, as the names at the top of the yardage list (Donte Jackson, Paulson Adebo, Dee Alford, for example) tend to appear at the top of the receptions allowed list. Similarly, the names at the bottom of the each lists tend to cross over (Xavien Howard, Jeff Okudah, Jaylon Johnson). This makes intuitive sense, as allowing a catch implies allowing positive receiving yards in almost all cases.

Cornerbacks with high PD totals relative to their targets often display exceptional timing, ball skills, and closing speed, making them critical assets in press-man coverage. Conversely, low PD totals, especially for corners with many targets, could signal challenges in effectively contesting throws or potential mismatches in coverage assignments.\n\nThese insights can help identify cornerbacks who excel at disrupting plays, even when targeted frequently, and those who might benefit from improved techniques or adjustments to pre-snap alignments. For example, defensive coordinators could leverage this metric to identify matchups where press-man coverage is yielding tangible results or consider alternative coverages when contested plays are not materializing. Offenses, on the other hand, might use PD data to avoid targeting high-performing cornerbacks in critical situations or exploit matchups where defenders struggle to break up passes.\n\nA limitation of passes defended is that they don't fully account for uncatchable throws or passes redirected away from a cornerback's coverage due to tight alignment. Thus, this metric works best when analyzed alongside other measures like targets over expected and completion percentage allowed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"defensed = totals_expected_aggregated[['displayName', 'defensed', 'expected_defensed', 'passes_defensed_oe', 'snaps']].sort_values(by='passes_defensed_oe', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\ndefensed.to_csv('defensed.csv', index=False)\n\ndefensed","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.975301Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.975806Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.009571Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-06T07:49:16.975755Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.008279Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":79,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             displayName  defensed  expected_defensed  passes_defensed_oe  \\\n0      Cornell Armstrong         4           1.968549            2.031451   \n1         Cameron Sutton         3           1.111666            1.888334   \n2          Taron Johnson         2           0.172485            1.827515   \n3          Avonte Maddox         2           0.333076            1.666924   \n4          Ahmad Gardner         5           3.854238            1.145762   \n5        Charvarius Ward         3           1.976346            1.023654   \n6            Denzel Ward         3           1.991172            1.008828   \n7          Paulson Adebo         3           1.993947            1.006053   \n8      Damarion Williams         2           0.996768            1.003232   \n9          Carlton Davis         3           2.076408            0.923592   \n10          Tariq Woolen         3           2.093407            0.906593   \n11       Patrick Surtain         3           2.095564            0.904436   \n12         Rasul Douglas         1           0.101641            0.898359   \n13          Chris Harris         1           0.118197            0.881803   \n14             Eli Apple         1           0.129296            0.870704   \n15       Amani Oruwariye         2           1.141702            0.858298   \n16       Marlon Humphrey         4           3.146663            0.853337   \n17         Xavien Howard         3           2.204711            0.795289   \n18           Jeff Okudah         3           2.275472            0.724528   \n19       James Bradberry         2           1.322982            0.677018   \n20          Jalen Ramsey         2           1.350779            0.649221   \n21     Marshon Lattimore         2           1.364886            0.635114   \n22         Marcus Peters         1           0.450169            0.549831   \n23      Darious Williams         4           3.799609            0.200391   \n24      Patrick Peterson         2           1.822204            0.177796   \n25           Darius Slay         2           1.877842            0.122158   \n26       Jaire Alexander         3           2.878167            0.121833   \n27        L'Jarius Sneed         3           2.895118            0.104882   \n28       Anthony Averett         1           0.924501            0.075499   \n29          James Pierre         2           1.930815            0.069185   \n30      Rachad Wildgoose         1           0.932638            0.067362   \n31          Marco Wilson         2           1.956772            0.043228   \n32       K'Waun Williams         1           0.966687            0.033313   \n33         Casey Hayward         1           0.972899            0.027101   \n34        Jace Whittaker         1           0.981375            0.018625   \n35          J.C.

Cornerbacks with high interception totals in press-man coverage likely possess not only strong coverage skills but also exceptional instincts, anticipation, and hand-eye coordination. These traits allow them to take calculated risks while maintaining tight coverage, often forcing quarterbacks to second-guess throws into their vicinity.\n\nCornerbacks excelling in interceptions provide tremendous value to defensive schemes by flipping field position and directly affecting the scoreboard. Defensive coordinators can analyze interception trends to identify opportunities for press alignments or coverage schemes that maximize these ball-hawking tendencies. For offenses, interception data underscores the importance of carefully considering pre-snap reads and avoiding overly aggressive throws against corners demonstrating a propensity for turnovers.\n\nThe challenge with interceptions in this context is that there is relatively little variance between the cornerbacks in the NFL, but the model can still provide an idea of who is producing slightly better or worse than the field, while outlier cases can provide insights into which corners are performing particularly well or poor in production. \n\nA caveat of interceptions is that they can sometimes be situational—products of poorly thrown balls, tipped passes, or opportunistic plays rather than purely strong coverage. Additionally, cornerbacks rarely targeted may have fewer interception opportunities despite excellent coverage skills. As such, interception data should complement metrics like targets, passes defended, and coverage grades to form a holistic view of performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"interceptions = totals_expected_aggregated[['displayName', 'interceptions', 'expected_interceptions', 'interceptions_oe', 'snaps']].sort_values(by='interceptions_oe', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\ninterceptions.to_csv('interceptions.csv', index=False)\n\ninterceptions","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.011156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.011531Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.043339Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.011497Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-06T07:49:17.042061Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":80,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"             displayName  interceptions  expected_interceptions  \\\n0        Joshua Williams              1                0.698469   \n1           Tariq Woolen              2                1.833819   \n2            Denzel Ward              1                0.922251   \n3           Levi Wallace              1                0.950696   \n4         Bryce Callahan              1                0.969265   \n5           Marco Wilson              1                0.971414   \n6            Darius Slay              1                0.971814   \n7           Kyler Gordon              1                1.005617   \n8           Josh Jackson              0                0.010215   \n9           Josiah Scott              0                0.010215   \n10         Cordale Flott              0                0.011237   \n11        Derek Stingley              0                0.011237   \n12           Coby Bryant              0                0.011237   \n13          Jerry Jacobs              0                0.012258   \n14        Jace Whittaker              0                0.012258   \n15         Isaiah Oliver              0                0.012258   \n16          Marcus Jones              0                0.013280   \n17              Sam Webb              0                0.013582   \n18           A.J.

The first three metrics especially provide valuable insights into the performance of cornerbacks in press alignment pre-snap. The fourth and fifth insights provide strong feedback on how effectively cornerbacks are producing on-ball. Overall, all five metrics tell one piece of the same story: How effective is a cornerback effective in press coverage. From these metrics teams can glean how well a player positions himself, how well the affect receivers while the ball is in the error, if they have tackling or angle weaknesses, if they are schemed towards or against, how productive they are on-ball, and many more. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Appendix** \nFuture improvements: \\\nAt the recommendation of the Big Data Bowl, the scope of this project was kept narrow. However, there are a number of potential improvements that could be made to provide deeper analysis and improve current insights. Here are a few:\n* Add coverage assignment tracking coordinates to measure starting distance between CB and WR. This can also be used to track inside/outside leverage.\n* Divide the field into quarters to determine whether or not the CB is in the slot, or on the outside.\n* If this data ever becomes available, a receiver's place in the QB's read order could be an exceptional feature to add to this project.\n* Expand assignment pool to include tight ends and running backs. While this would only add a small number of records, it would provide a full picture of the CBs' press performance.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
